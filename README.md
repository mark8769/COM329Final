# COM329Final
Final Exam Questions for chapters 8 - 14. Adding database of facts with prolog

Designed to be used as a study guide for Com 329 final exam.

Ask a question:

a("Approximately how many immigrants entered the Western Hemisphere between 1846 and 1932?").

Get result without having to go on quizlet to dig for answers. Albeit need to have some relevant info like past quizzes for questions.

** NOTE ** 

Has to match exact format of questions inside prolog for it to be able to find result. Most teachers probably pull these from the same place, as you can find these on quizlet. I recommend copy and pasting the whole question string (including periods), strings need to be in quotes.

Just trying out prolog a bit more so not to familiar with any methods, I think a fix could be something like contains() method if any in my answer rule
